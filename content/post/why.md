summary: Why this blog exists and what you can expect

Googling things is a major part of coding. I'm still to meet the engineer who remembers the all CLI commands of their project's workflow.

So yes, we all Google a million times a day - one out of two searches leads to StackOverflow. Actually I'm pretty sure that without StackOverflow and Github I would have picked a different job. Or at least my first internship wouldn't have turned out too well.

While the Internet is full of technical tutorials of all levels, rants and essays about what it's like to run these things in production are scarce. Many successful people do post well written inspiring articles. But few share the mistakes they've made along the way.

I will only blame one element: shame (call it ego pride coolness business whatever).

There shouldn't be any. Trying to build something is a beautiful thing. Succeeding is just a bonus. I'll admit, a really nice bonus. They say it's the journey that counts so share it with us. Please.

I am far from successful, but this is what I'm attempting here. Share wrong doings in very bad English. Read at your own risk.
