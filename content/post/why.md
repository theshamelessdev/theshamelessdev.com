summary: Why this blog exists and what you can expect

Googling things is a major part of coding. I'm still to meet the engineer who remembers the all CLI commands of their project's workflow.

So yes, we all Google a million times a day. Stackoverflow often goes a long way. Actually I'm pretty sure that without Stackoverflow I would have picked a different job. Or at least my first internship wouldn't have turned out so well.

So on a typical day, Google would take us to tons of indie developer blogs with amazing content. I'm really grateful to all of these terrific people who taught me more than any university degree could.

But while the Internet is full of technical tutorials of all levels, rants and essays about what it's like to run these things in production are scarce. Some people (by people I mean stars) do post well written inspiring essays. But few low level Leads or CTOs share the mistakes they've made while learning to build great things as they were doing it.

I will only blame one element: shame.

And there shouldn't be. Trying to build something is a beautiful thing. Succeeding is just a bonus. I'll admit, a really nice bonus. They say it's the journey that counts so share it with us. Please.

This is what I'm attempting here. Share wrong doings in very bad English. Read at your own risk.
