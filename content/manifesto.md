Look back on your mistakes.

Stop using complicated terms to explain concepts.

Do not feel ashamed, everyone knows you're smart.

It takes a smart mind to admit mistakes without shame.

Admit you did it wrong.

Actually we're hipocrits cause this is an anonymous site.

Do not mention names or companies, we focus on the learning here, not blame.

Share what you learnt.

Open for all.

The first person is used just to ease the writing.
